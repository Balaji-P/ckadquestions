1. Create a Pod with three busy box containers with commands “ls; sleep 3600;”, “echo Hello World; sleep 3600;” and “echo this is the third container; sleep 3600” respectively and check the status
->
=============
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: 3-cnt-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: pod-1
   image: busybox
   command: ["/bin/sh","-c","--"]
   args: ["ls; sleep 10"]
 - name: pod-2
   image: busybox
   command: ["/bin/sh","-c","--"]
   args: ["echo hello; sleep 10"]
 - name: pod-3
   image: busybox
   command: ["/bin/sh","-c","--"]
   args: ["echo 3rd cnt;sleep 10"]

2. Check the logs of each container that you just created
-> done

3. Check the previous logs of the second container busybox2 if any
-> done -p

4. Run command ls in the third container busybox3 of the above pod
-> kubectl exec -it 3-pod -c 3-cnt

5. Show metrics of the above pod containers and puts them into the file.log and verify
-> kubectl top po 3-cnt-pod > file.log

6. Create a Pod with main container busybox and which executes this 
   "while true; do echo 'Hi I am from Main container' >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 5; done"
   and with sidecar container with nginx image which exposes on port 80. 
   Use emptyDir Volume and mount this volume on path 
   /var/log for busybox and on path /usr/share/nginx/html for nginx container. 
   Verify both containers are running
-> 
======
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx
 labels:
   app: my-nginx
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: shared
   emptyDir: {}
 containers:
 - image: busybox
   name: busybox
   command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "--"]
   args: ["mkdir -p /var/log; touch /var/log/index.html; while true; do echo 'Hi I am from Main container' >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 5; done"]
   volumeMounts:
   - name: shared
     mountPath: "/var/log"
 - image: nginx
   name: nginx
   volumeMounts:
   - name: shared
     mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"


7. Exec into both containers and verify that 
   main.txt exist and query the main.txt from sidecar container with curl localhost
-> done
