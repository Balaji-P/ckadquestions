 5. Create a Pod with an image Redis and configure a volume that lasts for the lifetime of the Pod
 6. Exec into the above pod and create a file named file.txt with the text ‘This is called the file’ in the path /data/redis and open another tab and exec again with the same pod and verifies file exist in the same path.
